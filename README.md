Rule 110
========

In Rust!

I was looking for something else to build in Rust so I built an implementation of the cellular automaton [Rule 110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110).

## How To Use This
Just enter a pattern of 0s and 1s to represent the different cells of the pattern.

## Example

    Rule 110
    ========

    Enter a starting pattern:
    01000
    01000000000
    01100000000
    01110000000
    01011000000
    ...

Note that your entered pattern is filled or reduced to a standard length of 80.
